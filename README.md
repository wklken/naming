NAMING
===================

> Naming is a hard[dest] part of programming, this repo may save your time.

## Background

I create some scripts(you can find them under bin/) via bash/python to analyze the huge projects, like the [kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes).

Get the name of interface/struct/function, and do some categorization.

## CONTENT

- [ALL.md](./ALL.md) auto generated, merged all the result into one file. 
- [golang: interface names](./golang_interface_names.md)
