NAMING
===================

> Naming is a hard[dest] part of programming, this repo may save your time.

## Background

I create some scripts(you can find them under bin/) via bash/python to analyze the huge projects, like the [kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes).

Get the name of interface/struct/function, and do some categorization.

## Projects

- [kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)

## AutoGenerated Content

You can use ctrl/cmd+f to search what you need
